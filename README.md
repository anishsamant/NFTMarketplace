# NFTMarketplace

This project provides sample code to build a simple NFT (Non-Fungible Token) based marketplace with Amazon Managed Blockchain.

# Motivation

The concept of NFTs plays well with human needs of ownership and authenticity. It is like a new barter system in the digital era. Today a lot of people are interested in investing a fair amount in NFTs. So we want to provide them a platform that allows them to have all such functionalities just in one place.
